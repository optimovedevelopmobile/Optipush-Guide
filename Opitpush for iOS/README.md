# <a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction
**Optipush** is Optimoveâ€™s mobile push notification delivery add-in module, powering all aspects of preparing, delivering and tracking mobile push notification communications to customers, seamlessly from within Optimove.<br>
 **Optimove SDK** for iOS includes built-in functionality for receiving push messages, presenting notifications in the app UI and tracking user responses.

## <a id="pre-reqs"></a>Pre-Requisites 

 1. [Optimove Mobile SDK for iOS](https://github.com/optimove-tech/iOS-SDK-Integration-Guide) implemented 
 
## <a id="configuration"></a>Optipush Configuration

### Notification Service Extension

In order to enable Optimove to track the push notifications, you'll need to add a **Notification Extension** to your project.

>Skip items 1-6 if you already have Notification Service Extension implemented in your project.
A notification service app extension ships as a separate bundle inside your iOS app. To add this extension to your app: 

1.  Select File > New > Target in Xcode.
2.  Select the Notification Service Extension target from the iOS > Application section.
3.  Click Next.
4.  Specify a name for your app extension.
5.  Click Finish.
6. In your `Podfile` add a new target matching the extension's name.
7. To that target, add the `pod 'OptimoveNotificationServiceExtension`' 

Example for the updated `Podfile`:
```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
target 'My Application' do #Your app target
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'OptimoveSDK'
end
target 'NotificationExtension' do #Your new extension target
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'OptimoveNotificationServiceExtension'
end
``` 

>Notes: 
> The extension versioning must be aligned with the application, so make sure that the extension's `Deployment Target` (found in the project's settings page) is the **same** as the app's `Deployment Target

8. In order to enable communication between the extension and the application, add an `App group` capability in both the app and the extension targets.
The group name convention should be: `group.<the application bundle id>.optimove`<br>

![\[Screenshot\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimove-tech/A/master/O/O%20for%20iOS/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-07-02%20at%2018.06.21.png)

To implement the service's logic open the `NotificationService.swift` file.
Inside, you'll find 2 callbacks that are defined by iOS:

- `didReceive( request: contentHandler:)` - Called with the content of the push notification
- `func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire()` - Called when the OS is about to _force kill_ the extension's process

Both of these callbacks must be implemented by **your** extension and forwarded to the **Optimove Notification Extension Module**.

9. Inside the `didReceive` callback create a `NotificationExtensionTenantInfo` with the same information that was provided by the PI team to create the `OptimoveTenantInfo` object in the app target.
```swift
let info = NotificationExtensionTenantInfo(endpoint: "htts://www.endpoint.com",
                                                   token: "ios-demo-token",
                                                   version: "ios.demo.version.1",
                                                   appBundleId: "com.optimove.sdk.demo")
        optimoveExtensionService = OptimoveNotificationServiceExtension(tenantInfo: info)
```
>Notes: 
>- The values should correspond to the tenant info provided by the Product Integration team.
>- The `appBundleId` refers to the app bundle Id from the application target (not from the Notification extension target)
10. Forward the callback to the `OptimoveNotificationServiceExtension`. In order to identify if the message was processed by Optimove, add the following:
```swift
optimoveExtensionService.didReceive(request, withContentHandler: contentHandler)
        if !optimoveExtensionService.isHandledByOptimove 
```
11. Finally, if the message was processed by Optimove let it know that the extension is about to be terminated by the OS through the `serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire` callback:
```swift
override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() 
{
    if optimoveExtensionService.isHandledByOptimove {
        optimoveExtensionService.serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire()
    } else {
        if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent =  bestAttemptContent {
            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
        }
    }
}
```
Example for full implementation:
```swift
override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void)
{
    let info = NotificationExtensionTenantInfo(endpoint: "htts://www.endpoint.com",
                                                token: "ios-demo-token",
                                                version: "ios.demo.version.1",
                                                appBundleId: "com.optimove.sdk.demo")
    // Store as a property of the class to implement the serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire callback
    self.optimoveExtensionService = OptimoveNotificationServiceExtension(tenantInfo: info)
    
    self.optimoveExtensionService.didReceive(request, withContentHandler: contentHandler)
    if !optimoveExtensionService.isHandledByOptimove {
        // Reach this section if the notification was not processed by Optimove
        self.contentHandler = contentHandler
        self.bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)
        
        if let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent {
            // Modify the notification content to YOUR app's needs here...
            bestAttemptContent.title = "\(bestAttemptContent.title) [modified]"
            
            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
        }
    }
}
    
override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() 
{
    // Forward the callback to Optimove only if the notification was initially processed by Optimove in the didReceive callback 
    if optimoveExtensionService.isHandledByOptimove {
        self.optimoveExtensionService.serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire()
    } else {
        if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent =  bestAttemptContent {
            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
        }
    }
}
```
### User Notification Center Delegate
This section is implemented inside your **App target**
The Optimove SDK uses the **UserNotifications** module to present and monitor notifications.<br>
To do so, it must have access to the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`. To not be intrusive towards the hosting app and allow it to perform its custom logic the SDK **requires** the app to implement the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`. <br>

While the `AppDelegate` is not required to be the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, the delegate must be set in the `AppDelegate`'s `application(_:, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` callback.

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate 
{    
    var window: UIWindow?   
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool 
    {
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```

The SDK needs 2 callbacks of the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` to be forwarded. The SDK returns a `Bool` indicating whether the it processed the callback or should the app process it.
```swift
//
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
        didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
        withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) 
{
    // Forward the callback to the SDK first
    if !Optimove.sharedInstance.didReceive(response: response,withCompletionHandler: completionHandler)
    {
        // The callback was NOT processed by the SDK, apply your app's logic here
        completionHandler()
    }
}
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
        willPresent notification: UNNotification,
        withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) 
{
    // Forward the callback to the SDK first
    if !Optimove.sharedInstance.willPresent(notification: notification, withCompletionHandler: completionHandler)
    {
        // The callback was NOT processed by the SDK, apply your app's logic here
        completionHandler([.alert, .sound, .badge])
    }
}
```
Finally, to present a notification the app must have permission from the user to do so. At a convenient and appropriate point inside your app add the following to trigger a request for permission.
``` swift
// Request permission to show notifications (Relevant for Optipush only)
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert]) { (grant, error) in 
    // Your app specific logic goes here
}
```
- If the user has *not allowed* notifications in the past, they won't be prompted again by this function. Instead the app needs to redirect the user (via `UIAlertController` for example) to the Settings app, where they can change your app's notifications permission.

- For more information about `UserNotifications` see [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications)

## <a id="deep linking"></a>Deep Linking
To route users back to a specific screen inside the application from by opening an Optipush notification, you must support *Deep Linking*.
Other than _UI attributes_, an **_Optipush Notification_** can contain metadata linking to a specific screen within your application, along with custom (screen specific) data.<br>
To support deep linking, you should:
* Enable Associated Domains:
In your project capabilities, add the dynamic link domain with `applinks:` prefix and without any `https://` prefix that will be **provided to you by Optimove Product Integration team**
  
![associated_domain.png](https://s9.postimg.cc/hqrw4eqm7/associated_domain.png)
<br>
Inside your root `ViewControler` (the very first controller), conform to the `OptimoveDeepLinkCallback` protocol and implement the `didReceive(dynamicLink:)` method. That method receives an `OptimoveDeepLinkComponents` as argument, which contains:
- **ScreenName**: The name of the targeted `ViewController`.
- **Query**: Optional, additional data that was carried with the deep link<br>
At last, register as Optimove deep link responder.
  
Example:
````swift
override func viewDidLoad()
{
    super.viewDidLoad()
    Optimove.sharedInstance.register(deepLinkResponder: OptimoveDeepLinkResponder(self))
}
func didReceive(deepLink: OptimoveDeepLinkComponents?)
{
    if let deepLink = deepLink {
        if let vc = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: deepLink.screenName) {
            self.navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
        }
    }
}
````
  
## <a id="test mode"></a>Enabling Test Mode
 
You can test an **Optipush template** on your device *before* having to create an **Optipush campaign**.
To enable _"test campaigns"_ on one or more devices, call the `Optimove.sharedInstance.startTestMode()` method.<br>
To stop receiving "test campaigns" call `Optimove.sharedInstance.stopTestMode()`.<br>
  
````swift
class ViewController: UIViewController 
{
    @IBAction func startReceivingOptipushTestNotifications(_ button: UIButton)
    {
        Optimove.sharedInstance.startTestMode()
    }
    @IBAction func stopReceivingOptipushTestNotifications(_ button: UIButton)
    {
        Optimove.sharedInstance.stopTestMode()
    }
}
````

>**Notes:**
>- It is recommended to maintain 2 apps - one with test mode enabled (for internal purposes ONLY) and one without test mode enabled (for the general public).
>- The app that is published to the App Store must NOT have the test mode enabled.

<br>

# <a id="Post setup"></a>Post-Setup

## <a id="notification template"></a>Create & Test notification templates

Once Optimove has enabled Optipush as an execution channel for your Optimove instance, you can begin creating and testing your first Optipush template.
>Note: In order to be able to test your templates, the test mode must be [enabled](https://github.com/optimove-tech/A/tree/master/O/O%20for%20A#enabling-test-mode) within your mobile app.<br>

### Create  an Optipush Template
 1. Go to the Manage Templates page and choose 'Optipush' from the Channel drop-down menu. <br>
 2. Enter values for the following fields:
    - Template Name- Name te template 
     - Template Title - Title of push template
     - Message - Message of the template <br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimove-tech/Optipush-Guide/master/Opitpush%20for%20iOS/1.png)
<br>
 3. Personalization - you can personalize the notification by adding dynamic tags and emojis to the notification. <br>
 4. Preview - you can preview the push template notification before sending it out. <br>
 5. **Deep links** (Optional) - choose the app (iOS) and select the target screen in your app that you want your customers to be directed to when opening the message. <br>
 
 >Notes:
 >- In order to add Deep Links to the drop-down menu, please send the list of screen names to your CSM that you have configured in your app as described [here](https://github.com/optimove-tech/A/tree/master/O/O%20for%20iOS#deep-linking).
 >- *If a Deep Link is not chosen, the customer will be directed to the main screen when opening the message.* 
 >- When creating templates for Optipush, if the template is targeted for a specific device (iOS/Android), it is recommended to add the device name to the template naming convention. This way it will be identifiable when choosing a template for a campaign targeting a specific device.<br>
 
### Test an Optipush Template
1. **Validate** - validates the push notification template to make sure all mandatory fields are completed and contain no errors. <br>
2. **Send Test**  - clicking this link will send the push notification template to all devices that have the app installed with the test mode enabled.<br>


## <a id="Optipush campaign"></a>Set up an Optipush campaign

### Run Campaign

Please follow these steps in order to run a pre-scheduled campaign via execution channel **Optipush**.<br>
1. From the main menu go on *One-to-One Campaigns* --> click on *More* from the drop-down menu --> click on ***Run Campaign***.  <br>
2. Go through Steps 1 & 2 of the Run Campaign wizard as you would for any campaign. <br>
3. In Step 3 (Execution Details) choose from the *Channel* drop-down menu *Optipush*. This action will open the **Optipush Options** window.<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimove-tech/Optipush-Guide/master/Opitpush%20for%20iOS/2_a.png)
<br>
5. Choose from the *App* drop-down menu if you would like to run the campaign for your iOS app, Android app, or both by selecting the relevant box(es).<br>
6. Choose the relevant template for the *Template* drop down menu that you would like the targeted audience to receive.<br>
7. Continue through the remaining steps of the Run Campaign wizard to schedule the campaign for your preferred dates and times.
