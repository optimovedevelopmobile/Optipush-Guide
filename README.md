# Executing Push Notifications (Optipush)

Optipush is Optimoveâ€™s mobile push notification delivery add-in module, powering all aspects of preparing, delivering and tracking mobile push notification communications to customers, seamlessly from within Optimove.

Optimove Mobile SDK includes built-in functionality for receiving push messages, presenting notifications in the app UI and tracking user responses. Once the Optimove SDK is running, you do not need to implement anything else in your code for these functions to operate.

Additional functionality, such as the use of deep linking and testing Optipush templates, is also supported. Implementing these features in your code is described in the following sections.

For more information on how to add Optipush to your account, please contact your CSM or your Optimove point of contact.
